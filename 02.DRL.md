1. Syntax: SELECT <set of column names> FROM <table_name>;
2. Order of execution from RIGHT to LEFT.
3. Q. Can we use SELECT keyword without using FROM clause?
    1. Yes, using DUAL Tables.
    2. Dual tables are dummy tables created by MySQL, help users to do certain obvious actions without referring to user
    dened tables.
    3. e.g., SELECT 55 + 11;
    SELECT now();
    SELECT ucase(); etc.

4. WHERE
- **Definition:** Reduces rows based on given conditions.
- **Example Query:**
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Worker WHERE SALARY > 80000;
  ```

5. BETWEEN
- **Definition:** Selects values within a given range (inclusive of the boundary values).
- **Example Queries:**
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Worker WHERE SALARY BETWEEN 80000 AND 300000;
  ```

---

6. IN
- **Definition:** Reduces the need for multiple `OR` conditions.
- **Example Query:**
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Worker WHERE DEPARTMENT IN ('HR', 'Admin');
  ```

---

7. AND / OR / NOT
- **AND:** Combines multiple conditions where all must be true.
- **OR:** Combines conditions where at least one must be true.
- **NOT:** Excludes rows that meet the specified condition.
- **Example Queries:**
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Worker WHERE DEPARTMENT = 'HR' OR DEPARTMENT = 'Admin';
  SELECT * FROM Worker WHERE DEPARTMENT NOT IN ('HR');
  ```

---

8. IS NULL
- **Definition:** Filters rows with `NULL` values in a column.
- **Example Query:**
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Worker WHERE FIRST_NAME IS NULL;
  ```

---

9. Pattern Searching / Wildcards (`%`, `_`)
- `%`: Represents any number of characters (0 to n).
- `_`: Represents exactly one character.
- **Example Queries:**
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Worker WHERE FIRST_NAME LIKE '%i%'; -- i kahi bhi ho sakta hai naam hai
  SELECT * FROM Worker WHERE FIRST_NAME LIKE '_i%'; -- i second position pe hi hona chahiye
  ```

---

10. ORDER BY
- **Definition:** Sorts the result set in ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order  data retrieved using WHERE clause.
- **Example Queries:**
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Worker ORDER BY SALARY; -- defaul ASC
  SELECT * FROM Worker ORDER BY SALARY DESC;
  ```

---

11. GROUP BY
- **Definition:** Groups data based on one or more columns, often used with aggregation functions.
- Generally used in a SELECT statement.
- Groups into category based on column given.
-  SELECT c1, c2, c3 FROM sample_table WHERE cond GROUP BY c1, c2, c3.
-  All the column names mentioned are SELECT statement shall be repeated in GROUP BY, in order to successfully
execute the query.
- Used with aggregation functions to perform various actions.
    1. COUNT()
    2. SUM()
    3. AVG()
    4. MIN()
    5. MAX()
- **Example Queries:**
  ```sql
  SELECT DEPARTMENT, COUNT(DEPARTMENT) FROM Worker GROUP BY DEPARTMENT;
  SELECT DEPARTMENT, AVG(SALARY) FROM Worker GROUP BY DEPARTMENT;
  SELECT DEPARTMENT, MIN(SALARY) FROM Worker GROUP BY DEPARTMENT;
  SELECT DEPARTMENT, MAX(SALARY) FROM Worker GROUP BY DEPARTMENT;
  SELECT DEPARTMENT, SUM(SALARY) FROM Worker GROUP BY DEPARTMENT;
  ```

---

12. DISTINCT
- **Definition:** Returns unique values from a column.
- SELECT DISTINCT(col_name) FROM table_name;
- SQL is smart enough to realise that if you are using GROUP BY and not using any aggregation function, then
you mean “DISTINCT”.
- **Example Queries:**
  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT DEPARTMENT FROM Worker;
  SELECT DEPARTMENT FROM Worker GROUP BY DEPARTMENT; -- Alternative using GROUP BY
  ```

---

13. GROUP BY HAVING
- **Definition:** Filters grouped data using conditions, similar to `WHERE`, but applied to groups.
- **WHERE vs HAVING:**
  - `WHERE` filters rows before grouping; `HAVING` filters groups after grouping.
  - `HAVING` is used with `GROUP BY`, while `WHERE` can be used without it.
  - Both have same function of ltering the row base on certain conditions.
  - WHERE clause is used to lter the rows from the table based on specied condition
  - HAVING clause is used to lter the rows from the groups based on the specied condition.
  - HAVING is used aer GROUP BY while WHERE is used before GROUP BY clause.
  - If you are using HAVING, GROUP BY is necessary.
  -  WHERE can be used with SELECT, UPDATE & DELETE keywords while GR
- **Example Query:**
  ```sql
  SELECT DEPARTMENT, COUNT(DEPARTMENT) FROM Worker GROUP BY DEPARTMENT HAVING COUNT(DEPARTMENT) > 2;
  ```
```
