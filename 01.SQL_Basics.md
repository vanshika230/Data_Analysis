1. SQL: Structured Query Language, used to access and manipulate data.
    1. SQL used CRUD operations to communicate with DB.
          CREATE - execute INSERT statements to insert new tuple into the relation.
    2. READ - Read data already in the relations.
    3. UPDATE - Modify already inserted data in the relation.
    4. DELETE - Delete specic data point/tuple/row or multiple rows.

2. SQL is not DB, is a query language.
3. What is RDBMS? (Relational Database Management System)
    1. Software that enable us to implement designed relational model.
    2. e.g., MySQL, MS SQL, Oracle, IBM etc.
    3. Table/Relation is the simplest form of data storage object in R-DB.
    4. MySQL is open-source RDBMS, and it uses SQL for all CRUD operations
    5. MySQL used client-server model, where client is CLI or frontend that used services provided by MySQL server.
4. Difference between SQL and MySQL
    SQL is Structured Query language used to perform CRUD operations in R-DB, while MySQL is a RDBMS used to
    store, manage and administrate DB (provided by itself) using SQL.
## SQL DATA TYPES (Ref: hps://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_datatypes.asp)
1. In SQL DB, data is stored in the form of tables.
2. Data can be of different types, like INT, CHAR etc.
3. Size: TINY < SMALL < MEDIUM < INT < BIGINT.
4. Variable length Data types e.g., VARCHAR, are best to use as they occupy space equal to the actual data size.
5. Values can also be unsigned e.g., INT UNSIGNED.
## Types of SQL Commands 
1. DDL (data denition language): defining relation schema.
    1. CREATE: create table, DB, view.
    2. ALTER TABLE: modication in table structure. e.g, change column datatype or add/remove columns.
    3. DROP: delete table, DB, view.
    4. TRUNCATE: remove all the tuples from the table.
    5. RENAME: rename DB name, table name, column name etc.
2. DRL/DQL (data retrieval language / data query language): retrieve data from the tables.
    1. SELECT
3. DML (data modication language): use to perform modications in the DB
    1. INSERT: insert data into a relation
    2. UPDATE: update relation data.
    3. DELETE: delete row(s) from the relation.
4. DCL (Data Control language): grant or revoke authorities from user.
    1. GRANT: access privileges to the DB
    2. REVOKE: revoke user access privileges.
5. TCL (Transaction control language): to manage transactions done in the DB
    1. START TRANSACTION: begin a transaction
    2. COMMIT: apply all the changes and end transaction
    3. ROLLBACK: discard changes and end transaction
    4. SAVEPOINT: checkout within the group of transactions in which to rollback.
## MANAGING DB (DDL)
1. Creation of DB
    1. CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS db-name;
    2. USE db-name; //need to execute to choose on which DB CREATE TABLE etc commands will be executed.
    //make switching between DBs possible.
    3. DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS db-name; //dropping database.
    4. SHOW DATABASES; //list all the DBs in the server.
    5. SHOW TABLES; //list tables in the selected DB.
