# SUBQUERY 
1. **Outer Query Depends on Inner Query**
   - The result of the outer query depends on the result of the inner query.

2. **Alternative to Joins**
   - Subqueries can serve as an alternative to joins.

3. **Nested Queries**
   - Subqueries exist within other queries to provide results.

4. **Basic Subquery Syntax**
   ```sql
   SELECT column_list(s) 
   FROM table_name 
   WHERE column_name OPERATOR 
   (SELECT column_list(s) 
    FROM table_name 
    [WHERE]);
   ```
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE col1 IN (SELECT col1 FROM table1);
     ```

5. **Three Main Uses of Subqueries**
   - Inside a `WHERE` clause.
   - Inside a `FROM` clause.
   - Inside a `SELECT` clause.

6. **Subquery Using FROM Clause**
   ```sql
   SELECT MAX(rating) 
   FROM (SELECT * FROM movie WHERE country = 'India') AS temp;
   ```

7. **Subquery Using SELECT Clause**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       (SELECT column_list(s) FROM T_name WHERE condition), 
       columnList(s) 
   FROM T2_name WHERE condition;
   ```

8. **Derived Subquery**
   ```sql
   SELECT columnList(s) 
   FROM (SELECT columnList(s) FROM table_name WHERE [condition]) AS new_table_name;
   ```

9. **Co-related Subqueries**
   - A correlated subquery executes once for each candidate row considered by the outer query.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT *
     FROM employee e1
     WHERE 3 = (
         SELECT COUNT(e2.age)
         FROM employee e2
         WHERE e2.age > e1.age
     );
     ```

### JOIN vs. SET Operations
| **Aspect**                     | **JOIN**                                        | **SET Operations**                          |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Combines multiple tables based on matching condition. | Combines results horizontally.               | Combines results vertically.               |
| Resulting set from two or more SELECT statements. | Column-wise combination.                     | Row-wise combination.                      |
| Data types of two tables can be different.      | Data types of corresponding columns must match. | Datatypes of corresponding columns must match. |
| Generates both distinct or duplicate rows.     | Always generates distinct rows.              |
| The number of column(s) selected may or may not be the same from each table. | Number of column(s) must be the same.       |

## SQL Code Examples

### Schema Creation

```sql
CREATE TABLE Worker (
    WORKER_ID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    FIRST_NAME CHAR(25),
    LAST_NAME CHAR(25),
    SALARY INT(15),
    JOINING_DATE DATETIME,
    DEPARTMENT CHAR(25)
);

CREATE TABLE Bonus (
    WORKER_REF_ID INT,
    BONUS_AMOUNT INT(10),
    BONUS_DATE DATETIME,
    FOREIGN KEY (WORKER_REF_ID) REFERENCES Worker(WORKER_ID) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE employee (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    fname VARCHAR(50),
    lname VARCHAR(50),
    Age INT,
    emailID VARCHAR(100),
    PhoneNo INT,
    City VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Client (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    age INT,
    emailID VARCHAR(100),
    PhoneNo INT,
    City VARCHAR(50),
    empID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (empID) REFERENCES employee(id)
);

CREATE TABLE Project (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    empID INT,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    startdate DATE,
    clientID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (empID) REFERENCES employee(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (clientID) REFERENCES Client(id)
);
```

### Sample Data Insertion

```sql
INSERT INTO Worker 
    (WORKER_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, SALARY, JOINING_DATE, DEPARTMENT) VALUES
    (001, 'Monika', 'Arora', 100000, '14-02-20 09.00.00', 'HR'),
    (002, 'Niharika', 'Verma', 80000, '14-06-11 09.00.00', 'Admin'),
    (003, 'Vishal', 'Singhal', 300000, '14-02-20 09.00.00', 'HR'),
    (004, 'Amitabh', 'Singh', 500000, '14-02-20 09.00.00', 'Admin');

INSERT INTO employee (id, fname, lname, Age, emailID, PhoneNo, City)
VALUES
    (1, 'Aman', 'Proto', 32, 'aman@gmail.com', 898, 'Delhi'),
    (2, 'Yagya', 'Narayan', 44, 'yagya@gmail.com', 222, 'Palam'),
    (3, 'Rahul', 'BD', 22, 'rahul@gmail.com', 444, 'Kolkata');

INSERT INTO Client (id, first_name, last_name, age, emailID, PhoneNo, City, empID)
VALUES
    (1, 'Mac', 'Rogers', 47, 'mac@hotmail.com', 333, 'Kolkata', 3);
```

### Query Examples

1. **Select Employees with Age > 30**
   ```sql
   SELECT * 
   FROM employee 
   WHERE age IN (SELECT age FROM employee WHERE age > 30);
   ```

2. **Employees Working on More than One Project**
   ```sql
   SELECT * 
   FROM employee 
   WHERE id IN (
       SELECT empID 
       FROM Project 
       GROUP BY empID 
       HAVING COUNT(empID) > 1
   );
   ```

3. **Employees with Age Greater Than the Average Age**
   ```sql
   SELECT * 
   FROM employee 
   WHERE age > (SELECT AVG(age) FROM employee);
   ```
